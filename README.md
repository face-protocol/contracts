# Face Protocol Contracts

This repository contains contracts for Face Protocol. They are developed using Solidity and Hardhat

## Quick start

1. Make sure that you have Node.js and Yarn installed

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

3. Before the first time you build the project, you should temporarily comment line `import "./tasks";` in `hardhat.config.ts` (that is because Typescript autogenerated files are not present yet)

4. Now run compilation:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

5. Now you can uncomment line from point 3.

6. Copy `example.env` file and rename it to `.env`

7. Fill the variables with correct values

8. You can test contracts by running:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## How to deploy

To deploy contracts run:

```
npx hardhat --network [your network name] deploy
```

## Deployments

Contracts are currently deployed to Optimism Goerli, Base Goerli and Zora Goerli testnets. Addresses are below:
